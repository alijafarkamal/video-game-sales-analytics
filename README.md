# video-game-sales-analytics

**Project Description: Video Game Sales Analytics**  

This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of global video game sales data using **R**, leveraging powerful libraries like **ggplot2** (visualization), **dplyr/tidyr** (data wrangling), and **knitr** (reporting). The goal was to uncover regional sales trends, publisher performance, and genre popularity while addressing skewed data distributions through **log-normalization**.  

Key highlights:  
- **Data Transformation**: Engineered log-scaled sales columns to normalize skewed distributions, enhancing statistical robustness.  
- **Descriptive Insights**: Calculated mean, median, and variability metrics across regions, revealing North America’s dominance and Japan’s niche market trends.  
- **Visual Storytelling**: Created impactful visualizations, including interactive pie charts, histograms (sales by genre/platform), and boxplots to detect regional outliers.  
- **Publisher Analysis**: Identified top publishers (e.g., Rockstar Games, Activision) by release volume and sales impact, using dynamic bar plots.   

All outputs—cleaned datasets, statistical summaries, and high-resolution plots—were systematically saved to CSV/PNG files for seamless replication.
